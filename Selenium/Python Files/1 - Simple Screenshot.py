Use Case Description:
This use case demonstrates how to automate the process of capturing a webpage screenshot using Selenium.
The script launches a Chrome browser, navigates to the official Selenium website, waits briefly for the page to load, and saves a full-page screenshot to a designated folder.
This introduces basic Selenium commands such as launching the browser, navigating to a URL, and using save_screenshot() for visual documentation or testing purposes.
While it uses a simple time.sleep() for page loading, future use cases will incorporate more robust waiting strategies.
